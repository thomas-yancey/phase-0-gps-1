##What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I actually learned of some concepts I was struggling with that I was unaware of in this session. I had consistently only used the git pull and never git fetch --> git merge master/branch and was having issues getting it to work correctly. After some practice though I became more confident.


##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The use of Git and Github was more livened up when actually working with a partner. Actually going through the steps of committing and having someone else do the merge clarified how and why to do that. Also dealing with merge conflicts was something that was good to see how and why these occur. I had not delved into that previously and it was good to get help from a guide through that part.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
A couple that stand out were writing the comments for your partner/manager who would be reviewing your pull request. Also the reason to use git fetch / git merge instead of git pull. Another thing that came up was why we delete branches after merging and it was brought up to be debatable whether this is always the best practice.

##What still confuses you about git?
I think that a lot of my issues will come with working on big projects when branches could be made off of other branches and when that would be ideal, if it is even ideal.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I had a great time pairing in GPS. John was our guide and was extremely helpful. He was patient and would only interject if he thought we were stuck or going down a bad path which I liked. I went into it a little nervous working in front of / with someone else, but doing this really boosted my confidence in peer-coding settings.
