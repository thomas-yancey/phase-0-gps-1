##git commands used up until this point
- git add - will move untracked files to tracked files to be committed
- git commit - saves a copy of the file to the current working branch
- git checkout -b - git checkout allows you to switch from branch to branch, checkout -b allows you to create a new branch and also switch into it at the same time
- git push origin master - takes the changes you have committed and pushes them from your local to remote
- git clone [url.git] - takes a copy of a github repo and clones it locally to whatever directory you are in
- git status - shows your untracked and tracked files and what branch you are on

this is a small change that ruins everything
