**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I had a pretty good understanding of git concepts prior to the GPS session.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

I learned that the "git fetch/git merge" function is the same as the "git pull" function, and that there may be times that you want to fetch a file but not merge it locally, e.g. if you want to change something remotely but not save it locally.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked both my pair and the guide for minor clarifications along the way, e.g. "is this the correct syntax?" 

**What still confuses you about git?**

I think I got it down pretty well; at least the concepts I've learned thus far.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

Well it actually wasn't my first GPS as I previously completed a few weeks of DBC before switching cohorts/locations, but it was good! We had a few hiccups along the way, but they turned out to be learning opportunities. :)
